The most exciting part of this week was probably the running. I finally had a consistent week of easy runs and workouts, and I hit close to 80km for the week. The weekend was also relaxing, and we went to the nearby town of Metzingen for the first time.

## Street Food

There were two street food festivals this weekend, one in [Reutlingen,](http://streetfood-tour.de/) and the other in [Metzingen.](https://www.facebook.com/amiterrano/) The one in Reutlingen was a stop on a larger tour, while the one in Metzingen was just a local event. The Metzingen one was smaller, but had different trucks from the Reutlingen one.

## Outletcity

While we were in Metzingen we also went to [Outletcity.](https://www.outletcity.com/en/metzingen/) It's an outlet mall, with stores like Timberland, Nike, Adidas, Tommy Hilfiger, and more. The Nike store was incredibly hectic, with boxes of shoes thrown aside everywhere, and the store was packed with people. I didn't buy anything from Nike; I tried on a pair of Pegasus 32 that were on sale for around 60 euros, but wasn't happy with how they felt. I'm going to have to keep on the lookout for new running shoes though, as my current ones have over a thousand kilometers on them, and I think that's a good time to replace shoes. I only bought one thing from the outlets, a sweater type thing from [Pierre Cardin](https://pierrecardin.com/en/) for 10 euros.

## Running

This was the best week of running I've had in a long time. Easy runs were consistent, and I got in two workouts and a long run.

Monday - Rest.

Tuesday - [Easy run](https://www.strava.com/activities/1500832145) that felt really comfortable.

Wednesday - [Kilometer repeat](https://www.strava.com/activities/1502861623) workout, 3 x 1km with 2 min rest between kilometers, then a 6 minute rest, and 3 x 1km again. Went through all of them in 3:20-3:27, felt better than when I did this workout a few weeks ago.

Thursday - Another [easy run.](https://www.strava.com/activities/1504693813)

Friday - Another [easy run](https://www.strava.com/activities/1506422135) that felt more relaxed than Thursday.

Saturday - [5k tempo run.](https://www.strava.com/activities/1507349215) This did not feel good, the last 1500m were a struggle. The legs weren't used to 5 days in a row of running, really happy with the effort though.

Sunday - Great [long run](https://www.strava.com/activities/1509915427) spent listening to Evan Jager on the Nike Run Club app. Great way to end a consistent week of runs!

I don't want to speak too soon, but I think my mind is in the right place to get back into running consistently. There's a Bosch 5k run coming up in about a month, and I'm excited to see how much fitness I can get back before then.

Thanks for reading!
