The Interrail trip has officially begun! Travelling alone is an interesting experience, much different than any other kind of travel I've done before, but it's awesome. I met some great people at the only hostel I've stayed in so far (in Konstanz). One of them was from Malaysia and is studying at Iowa State University, and another was from Germany and biked to Konstanz from Freiburg (128km!). I'm currently sitting on a train to Innsbruck, Austria as I am writing this. The lake that Zurich is next to is directly out the left window of the train, and the view is absolutely beautiful.

## Konstanz

Konstanz was incredible, and I wish I could have stayed longer. The water in the lake (even just a 20 minute walk from the train station) was a shade or turquoise, and people were swimming everywhere.

I got off the train stop in the middle of the old city, and then proceeded to walk from there to my hostel, which was about a 30 minute walk away. It was sweltering, and the only thing I wanted to do was jump in the water and join the swimmers.

So after dropping my main bag and locking it in the hostel, I took my towel and a small bag down to swim.

## Innsbruck

The journey from Konstanz to Innsbruck was the first one that I used my Interrail pass on, as you can't use the pass in your country of home residence (Germany in my case). I chose the train route with the fewest transfers, that went from Konstanz to Zurich, and then from Zurich to Innsbruck.

We went right by Lake Walensee, which is another beautiful lake to look at. I think living in Germany has amplified the joy of swimming for me, because I want to swim in every single lake I see now.

## Very Early First Impressions

I'm really happy with the choice to buy an Interrail pass, as it allow
