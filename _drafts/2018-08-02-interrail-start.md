The Interrail trip has officially begun! Travelling alone has so far been an interesting experience, and is quite different from any other kind of traveling I've done before. I met some great people at the first hostel I stayed in (in Konstanz). One of them was from Malaysia and is studying at Iowa State University, and another was from Germany and biked to Konstanz from Freiburg (128km!). I'm currently sitting on a train to Innsbruck, Austria as I am starting to write this post, and the mountains and lakes are whizzing by.

This also means that my time at Bosch Sensortec has come to an end. I'm going to miss working there and living in Reutlingen. I think as far as first apartments go I didn't do too badly at all.

## Konstanz

Konstanz was incredible, and I wish I could have stayed longer. The water in the lake (even just a 20 minute walk from the train station) was a brilliant shade of turquoise, and people were swimming everywhere.

I got off the train stop in the middle of the old city, and then proceeded to walk from there to my hostel, which took about 30 minutes. It was sweltering, and the only thing I wanted to do was jump in the water and join the swimmers.

So after dropping my main bag and locking it in the hostel, I took my towel and a small bag down to swim.

## Innsbruck

The journey from Konstanz to Innsbruck was the first one that I used my Interrail pass on, as you can't use the pass in your country of home residence except for the first and last leg of your journey (Germany in my case). I chose the train route with the fewest transfers: from Konstanz to Zurich, and then from Zurich to Innsbruck.

The train rides did not go as smoothly as the rail schedule lead me to believe they would. The one from Konstanz to Zurich required me to take a local tram to a different bus stop where they took everyone who was supposed to be on that train to another station where I finally got on my orirignally planned train. This added about 30 minutes to my schedule, and unfortunately the train from Zurich to Innsbruck I wanted to catch only had a 25 minute window for me to catch on my original schedule.

So I had to spend 2 hours in Zurich (which was very nice actually, there is a park just outside a natural history museum that I sat in and read parts of numerous books).

After 2 hours had passed, I got on the first long-ish train ride of the trip, one that was supposed to last 3.5 hours. However, about 3/4 of the way through there was a section of railway closed because of a landslide, which meant everyone got off, and we took a bus to the next station, where we got right on another train that was waiting for use there. It was all very smoothly orgranized, and only added about 30 minutes to the overall journey time. Once I arrived in Innsbruck I was fortunate to have just enough time to walk to the hostel before it started raining.

There was also some great running trails just behind the hostel, which were just above sandy beaches that lined the river. I went for a 10k jog, the first one of the trip so far, and hopefully not the last.

## Salzburg

I wanted to spend as much time as I could in Salzburg, because I heard it was an incredibly beautiful city. I can now confirm this is true. The main thing that drew my attention was the proximity of sheer cliffs and a steep hill to the city center. There is also a river running through the main part of the city, but it was not as clear as the ones I saw in Zurich or Konstanz. I had booked a hostel that was close to the main station in Salzburg, so I only had to walk for 5 minutes right after I got off the train to get there. I left my bags in a locker, and was about to start walking around the city when I realized I wanted to have a bit more of a structured approach to my sightseeing. So I googled an [online walking tour](https://www.bigboytravel.com/europe/austria/salzburg/freewalkingtour/) of Salzburg, which led me around the city to all of its highlights. I skipped the restaurants, cafes, and anything food related that it mentioned, and I tried to see as many architectural and natural features as I could.

## Marseille

This was the first place that I spent more than one night in. The day that I arrived I explored the city, and the next day I made a trip to the [Calanques National Park,](http://www.calanques-parcnational.fr/fr) which is a 30 minute bus ride away from the center of Marseille.

## First Impressions

I'm really happy with the choice to buy an Interrail pass, as it allows me a ton of flexibility. I don't have to be commited to taking any specific train at any time, and if I want to stay a couple hours longer in a city I can. I'm going to try and stick to my schedule though, since I've paid for some hostels in advance, but the option to spend a couple more hours in a city is great. I think I will probably do this tomorrow, and take a chair lift to the
